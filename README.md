# ONScripter for SayaNoUta (ZH)
This is a very proprietary piece of software. 
I've only tested it with the ONScript platform game "Saya no Uta", which is ported onto the platform itself. 
I didin't even read the documentations for development of softwares for reading these ONScripts (surprise surprise), and I guessed most of my way through. 
That one game is guaranteed to work, but it might be the only one that will ever do.
